Thus, Regularization adds penalties to the parameters and avoids them weigh heavily. The coefficients are added to the cost function of the linear equation. Thus, if the coefficient inflates, the cost function will increase. And Linear regression model will try to optimize the coefficient in order to minimize the cost function.\n",
